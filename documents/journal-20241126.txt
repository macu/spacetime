I'm able to build the first iteration, but this project will require more than just me to bring to its full reality.

Heaven is coming. Every good thing belongs, just not everything has been fully formed. Beautiful things are born in darkness.

The database model for this project is a representation of a philosophy for our souls. Pour love into it. Be raw. Be honest. Dream, and reach beyond. Be gentle. Be compassionate. We will come out of the dark in good time.

At the core of each of us is the desire to love and be loved, but it shines out through the complex of our thoughts and pain ("ego"). What can be more healing than full acceptance? Each relationship is a space of shared memory, shared problems, shared hopes and dreams.

We'll find something really sound. Love yourself, and love others. You are accepted in Christ. There is a place, a future, and hope for every creature. God has dreams for everyone.

It's easy to get caught up in fantasy, and technology kind of brings a surface where we can visually reflect anything we can dream of. But remember, the universe is a wild, natural, living place.
