I think I am going to allow deleting texts.
I am feeling pretty embarassed about what I wrote and included in the repo.
That was at the height of a manic episode, and now it has been immortalized.
Deleting things is a valid choice.
It is very intimate to give a snapshot of your thoughts.
You worry people will love you less because of one thing or one moment.

Take it as an inspiration and example for naked text.

There's [potentially] way more to come.

The original idea for no deletion was the excitement I could imagine people would feel hovering over the submit button. Pretty exciting. But so much sadness in the world. Forgiveness and acceptance must be found. Too many [including me] can barely find their own love for themselbes. (Typo - ) I found a lot of beauty in this SPacetime idea at the time I found it. Something I could love. A place where a lot more people could get their voice out.

Whether anything more will come of it I don't know \_(ãƒ„)_/
