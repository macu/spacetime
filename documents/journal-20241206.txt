Layout ideas

Dashboard
- list top root spaces (all time checkins)
- list top root spaces (realtime; last 24 hours; to be implemented later)

Spaces list
- list one title per space
- order titles by checkin total, with titles the user checked in on first
- show text on titles, tags, texts, and naked texts

Space view (all time view)
- tabs to view space/subspaces, titles, tags, realtime / last 24 hours (to be implemented later), search
- list 10 titles (horizontal scroll) with view more (fixed top)
- list 20 tags (flex row) with view more (fixed bottom)
- subspaces list (shows everything by checkin total; scroll)
- search input to search for immediate subspaces by title, or to create a subspace
- add checkin on any title, tag, or subspace (checkin buttons show overall totals)
- expand any subspace

Stream of consciousness
- stream is created by author
- each naked text is submitted with a start time (time the user started typing) later than the created_at of the stream space
- naked texts are posted in the past, according to the time when they were started
- each naked text is submitted when the enter button is hit twice
- disable the paste function
- once stream is closed by author, it renders the full text entered by the author when viewed; other spaces may be added by anyone, but the stream the author created is displayed specially
