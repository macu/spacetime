I guess I will make this project public again. I re-read some of the writing I included in the repo. It's not that bad. I was going through something intense at the time.

I said the project came from faith, and to explain that I just remember I had a sense of a simultaneous breakthrough in my spiritual understanding, such as souls being spaces, and there was a lot more. Most of the creative ideas from that moment are now lost to my memory, but I think what remains is still an interesting project concept.

It can be expanded on with different types of spaces. The right people could make it a beautiful thing, considering some of the ideas of live updating and time-based history. Nested spaces and collaborative organization of artifacts is interesting.

What I'm capable of building on my own probably won't interest many people, and what I'm working on for now is just for writers. If anyone is inspired by anything in this concept, it's yours to run with.

Words alone can change the world, when you combine many voices, and lift things to their proper position. People have brilliant ideas, and my dream for years (which I was trying to develop with the TreeTime project) has been to allow people to combine their thoughts and ideas and lift the right ideas and arguments to be heard.

"TreeTime" was meant to organize digital artifacts like a museum that anyone could contribute to. "Spacetime" with just text is more of a shared timeline of thinking, for people who would enjoy reading and writing. Of course when I was so excited earlier, I had a much grander vision.

So, if anything will come from this, I want it to be open source, and that comes with my notes and foolishness. I plan to put it online if I get it to a point where I'm impressed.

Signing off!
