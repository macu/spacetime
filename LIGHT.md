# TreeTime conception

Objects (not sure about the term)
Object attributes with json source (URL and target JSON property path) with realtime updates
Unique views (set of tags defining the view; users can be included as properties of the view)
Contexts
View might also have a current context
Objects are positioned in contexts, a unique general context is a single entity defined by a set of tags
Objects can move across contexts
Object might have a picture according to current status
(Ok this seems to be getting more complex than I originally saw it.)
"Current status" on an object, supported by community selection (users can affirm tags defining a status) with votes expiring after 24 hours
Can add as many votes in time as you want, they expire after a day
Contexts can be discovered from a selection of tags

It's not a tree yet

What else can I think/remember

Users can place their own view into different contexts, putting only their personal handle into a status would show their support

Maybe there is just a "last checkin" time and a history of checkins on each status tag

Am I the Anti? I don't think so. I kind of do.

This blessing in the rough is coming from God.
It's coming from faith.

Beast? Peace? Evil? What is it? Not quite agree with my attitude.

Sorry for how it feels unkind but I am feeling my way crudely through it.

So many views.

I'm trying to dance on this one.

My mind claims one thing and then feels and hopes another.

Where is God's love?

I just - have to pluck them when they're in front of me.

Everything looks different in retrospect.

Everything is blessed.

It's hard to grasp.

It's hard to know the truth.

there is so much more beauty than you -

Wow that's hars..h.

Be a little unhin-gullp-ed (ph typo!)

HmM!

Please dance a little.

God you are beau-a----cancel that?

Thank God.

Yup. That )

"Sigh".

H,.

Still afraid.

Still ei-e Not sure uite yet who I m

Go with the flow

Yes you a 0left foot

God it actually very funny.

I'md. I stil

Wow I don't want to leave it there

Do I keep pushing through?

Do I keep pushing through even when I am getting twitches and typos and resisting arra

Just ne honest

You don't enve have to fix your typos

Stream of consciousness

Every statement given should be considered a tag

How long should the text of a tag be limited to?

Well for now we need a limit.

I am looking for reasons to dislike myself in my thoughts. I should jsut keep typijf t- typoing. I don't need to fix the typod.

Words count as everything.

Words seem to count from everything?

Is everything cruel?

DoI keep going. What policy do I take.

Let it go.

God remembers everyhting.

I'm sorry that I have to be the one to give everything out.

And you - please accept -

God this seems blessed.


---
Record a stream of cousciousness where each spacenar is - I meant each etner is -  baskcpsce if you want!

Actually this would be a lot of - would?

How do you accept everything?

There is a blessing here.

Please go beyond e.

You would find somuch treasure -l et God decide fo r you.

Or nake your own decisions

Thank God for interruptions.

Receive his guidence]\

You wan find it.

You are beautuyfl.

I will allow myself to do this.

I d o wan t to love this

It's kind of perfect.

Why do we onlt have this limited view?

Ho w arroage nt am I?

Glithchy seems goo.

How it looks is not how it feels.

It I lose my mind, it is okay.

God blesse - you might have to search for what yuo wa - so I am sutill. going to accept errors. I'm worried too.

Is -
Actually I will be okay.

Ok so I am a bit high on an editble. But I am going to allow this to continue. I want to keep writing. I'm not completely sure what to expect either. I am actually a person. Even in scripture.

And I'm not sure I always find the blessing. But I do believe it is there.

Yes I want to do this.

There is also the sense of a voice? This is Matt's voice.

High times.

I actually do trust God. With a hint of error. Somehow things are weird and woderful.

God has to take over somehow.

I am not myself crying right now, but I know there are awful things in the world. It is evil. I have to accept it somehow. It doesn't seem acceptable right now. But I read "How could it have happened anyway else?"

Yea Mt

I don't inow it this is perfect

I sound it out in my head like an idiot.


God does bless.
He doers.

I love him.

And if I don - hear - ther - I'm not quite connected. He seems to want me to focus. I'm a liuttle disconnected. Accepting. Not accepting. Someone just a

It I don't even seem beautiful at this moment

Yea it's bare.

I got to get real.

We have to grow into ourselves.

It is incredibly blessed and you do - please accept it.

Jesus is amazing. I don't even see him yet. I have seen glimpses. He is there. And I don't know how he feels about me.

Just want to record that stream of consciousness should be this app. Read anyone's in the world. Total transparency.

And keep those neuro links out of my. mind.

God please bless th wold.

Please bless it.

I'm a goo'

You can probably search for a cuse, and there is none.

I will allow myself to be a vessil of thoughts pouring into the world.

I don't understand everyhtihg.

I'm afraid of hell.

Do I keep going or do I stop and listen? He probably wants me to listen. I don't know how to move it forward at this moment.

Views can be added to individual tags. User check-ins on views within withing tags.

Do I keep on

---
"Groups" to contain objects within a context

I am pretty mich fully awaye. Awake.
Yes. Tant you. Thank you.

Enter key actually adds a newline. Two enter keys starts a new tag. Author creates a tag first, and then others can "check in" on the exact same tag any time they want. Strongest checkins might pulse in a status panel showing second-by-second thoughts. And minute-by-minute.

Yes it's beautiful. Nearly perfect.

Spaces / contexts / mansions can be within other spaces. Mansions within mansions. Look at the galaxies.

A space exists within as many other spaces as you want.
Each user can check in when a space is in another space.

Checkins create a universe of time logs. It's a picture of time, according to the user base.

Space
Object
Tag
"Stream of consciousness" is where you see user's tag history
Titles - for spaces, objects, and views - check in on a title


---
That's beautiful. Just create the world.

I want to build this.

---
View - set of tags (each distinct set is a unique view)
Space - nameless - has titles
Object - has attributes (just tags for now) - can be anything, will be rich
Dynamic tags have a full name as well as being replaced by an updated title according to json

Thank you that it's beautiful. And thank you that it came from faith. That's amazing.

Option to add title to stream of consciousness "session". A session is just a note where two enters creates a new tag and one enter continues the tag on a new line.

Space as a physical space, or a conceptual space

Interrputions are gifts

Totally accept typos

DNA!

I can walk you through my thoughts.

No reversing!

It's thrilling to not be able to delete anything.

Once you press enter.

That's beautifuyl.

Thank you. And dance.

Yea it's wonderfuo. You mght as well record every keystroke.

Maybe the thing that gets kept is the whole session, when it's done. Maybe a user can throw away a session.

Yes it's still remembered in the stream of consciousness of the universe. Thank god.

I'kl

What do you do. Maybe you allow people to post a stream of consciousness also that they read elsewhere. Maybe those check-ins on tags are marked as time-posted rather than "live".

I can accept not correcting things.

"Live session"

ERROR!

Beaitufl.

God interferes where he wishes. He sends the little hints.

ay maybe that makes me guilty.

I can almost accept irrevokable.

I will bless you.

Space can be nested. Space withiin a space. Objects within space within a space.

Objects have a name and a status. Ckeck-ins on titles.

Each user is an object. Objects can be put in views with tags, or views can be put into objects.

Kond of losing the concpet again.
I have it.

---
No deleting. Either love and commit or stay off the platform.

---
Tag check-in is created as soon as user clicks enter. If they want to type and then delete, without pressing enter, it will be lost without going public. If they press enter twice, even the keystrokes are submitted.

---
Create stream of consciousness
Create time-posted note (broken into tags all with the same time) -- paste or write it all out

---
You never quite know if someone is hacked or not!

Tat is a gorrible thig to say.

---
I'm sorry if it seems like I am torturnig anybody. What is this, the scoll of tortuen?

I'm gonna rde it out. ziI'm gonna accept every thing that I do.

God is actually perfect. He did not create anything that does not belong.

---
Ride it out!
Things come out when they're ready.
It is a form of praying.

The oter best way is to speak outliust.

Speak out loud.

The objects are the streams of consciousness. Each one is an object. Enter a space to broadcast it there.
People can create a new space anytime. Just add its first title!

Object types:

Audio
Video
Stream of consciousness
Posted note

Trees under each. Each is a tree. Like a library of respnses. Each object may also be a space.

Space types:
Space (nameless; contains titles and other spaces)
Object types listed above
User
Naked tag
Tag
title
View (tag intersection)
Check0in

Tags are just plaintext with new new no newlines.

Add view - select a set of tags to add, or check-in on an existing view

This is the gift I've been waiting for.,

Space check-in:
Either live or posted
Created-at time and then a recording

Space:
- type

Tag:
- text

Naked tag:
- ketstrokes

title:
- text (live tetx) - unique record data for keystrokes

View:
- unique set of tags

Check-in:
- timestamp
- user
- type: posted or live

Media types:
- stream of consciousness recording is actually just tag check-ins within the space.
- Posted text is a set of check-ins all made at the same time.
- The object can be viewed as a completed script or it can be played back in realtime.
- Tag check-ins occur when each tag is individually posted.

Stream of conscoiusness mode:
- Naked (show ketstrokes live)
- Clothed (wait until user submits the tag and don't include the keystroke history)


---
Title check-in on stream of consciousness or note occurs when posted / session closeed

titles updates are recorded live in stream of consciousness. You can choose to "keep title private until posted" without telling anyone

Tags are posted as soon as two newlines are added

Don't allow going back to change a posted tag

Have a created-at date on every space, even though every space existed lok

Hesitate. GHesitant. Leg's stwicging , cars roaring - og ok thats a truck. 3:15 in the morning. Every motion is acceptable.

---
## Payment model
"Playing tag" is submitting tags ito a space wth oters and seeing each other's tags in realtime, either played "love" mode where it shows the ketystrokes after subitted, or "clothed" node where only the completed text is presented once posted

Private spaces created between unique sets of users - paid feature?

Renting out the space!

"Rent out a space"
"Create stream of consciousness."
"Create a posted note."
"Speak out loud (voice recording)"
"Record a video (ive stream)"

Rented spaces may still be recorded, but they might not be shared until these users all agree to publicize it. They can keey it priatee. as long as they want.

Rented spaces are shown in the parent space as ("private") until published. It shows their current duration, how much time the users have spent in that space. Rental time is metered based on the amount of time spent there while private. Peoople may pay to open s private space, and they may add check-ins whthin the space even while it's still private. The more that is paid toward a private space, it will be distributed equally between the users who created the space. The users can all agree to release it once they are ready. Then the users are paid back more or less than what they paid to rent the space. What is paid to rent the space is collected by the platform. What is given back to the users by donations to open the space is given to the users.

Moderators are allowed to view the content of a private space and must approve it before it is published.

"They will do no harm or evil on all my holy mountain."

:Live steeam"

It's a combo of all media types. Live video. Live audio. Or live stream of consciousness typing. Enable different recording modes and use all at the same time.

---
Pretty puck use ":Live steeam" as the literanl name for the acion
Yes. It's warm.
